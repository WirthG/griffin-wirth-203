### Summary

 
This section of the book talks about how software engineering is not just writhing code, but having all the tools to build and maintain the code.
This stuck out to me because I never thought about the live side of someones code. Fixing code is one thing and something we all have done but maintaining what you engendered is another tool that I definitely need in my tool belt.
The section gives three ways software engineers should think about when designing, architecting, and writing their code.
1. Time and Change
    - Code needs to adapt over time if you want it to stay relevant, useful, and not a hassle to use.
2. Scale and Growth
    - With the world of computer science constantly changing. Recently we've seen a surge in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain. New elements to computer science can effect your work.  
3. Trade-offs and Costs
    - Some changes happening to computer science might make you ask the question, "What is the best way to resolve this?". The answer might be changing/evolving but cost also takes into affect with that. Sometimes the answer might be a trade off to something that can do it better. Like the surge in new aspects we talked about in scale and growth.

The Google Perspective section was a unique look into how a top tier company like Google catagories their software engineering landscape.
* Culture - The development of software is a team effort, and that proper cultural principles are essential for an organization to grow and remain healthy.
* Processes - Google has tried to emphasize what they have found to work over time and at scale as well as identify areas where they donâ€™t yet have satisfying answers.
* Tools - How Google leverage their investments in tooling infrastructure to provide benefits to their codebase as it both grows and ages. 

The book also states that, " This book does not intended to be a sermon. Google itself still imperfectly applies many of the concepts within these pages. The lessons that we have learned, we learned through our failures: we still make mistakes, implement imperfect solutions, and need to iterate toward improvement." It recognizes its place in the computer science world, specifically in the software engineering part and they want to help us learn by their trials and tribulations.

### Action Items & Reflection

The first section of this book reminds me that my job is not done after I write my code, but my job is also to maintain my code and help it evolve with new aspects of computer science coming out all the time.
The first section of the book has also shown me that places like Google know the importance of what to think about when designing, architecting, and writing their code. I cant wait to apply these concepts to this class this semester.
