### Summary

 
The first chapter of FuzzingBook introduced the fundamentals of software testing and how important the basics of software testing is.

Software Testing
 - To evaluate a program and identify defects and issues.  
 - Identify and fix bugs during the process. 
 - Have the software meet the specified requirements. 
 - Reducing the risk of software failures in deployment.

Some ways that I saw the FuzzingBook tested the software was:
 1. Print() Statements
    - The printing test is a good and easy way to see into if the program is running correctly. This test can be implemented whenever you are questioning what you just coded.
 2.  Unit Testing
    - Unit testing is to make sure that the unit (method, class, or component) is working the way you expected. You can test across a range of **valid** and **invalid** inputs. Unit tests should run every time you commit a change to the source code repository, and you should run them on your development machine as well. This will help you and your team when deploying code. 
 3. Code Reviewing
    - An extra pair of eyes on your code, working or broken, is always a good thing. After working and staring at your code for a while, it is easy to be done if it "technically" works. A fresh pair of **code experienced** eyes can cath things you didn't and even give you ideas to improve your code. Remember to do a basic functionality testing before the code review.

### Action Items & Reflection

All of these test methods are good ways to keep your code clean and correct for you and your team. 
These software tests can make the merging process go smooth and can make implementing big projects go off with little to no problems. Which is always so satisfying.
